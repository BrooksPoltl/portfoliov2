## Words

[source](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words)

- define new terms that might be unfamiliar
- use terms consistently (you dont change variable names in the code)
- use acronyms properly ex: Telekinetic Tactile Network (TTN) to introduce the acronym to the reader
- problematic words: it, they, them, their, this, that. Make sure these cannot be misinterpreted for other things.

## Active Voice

[source](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/active-voice)

Technical documentation should usually be written in active voice.

Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target

example of active voice: The player kicks the soccer ball

passive verb = form of be + past participle verb

### passive words

- be
- is, are
- was, were

### past particle verb

A verb ending in 'ed'

ex: interpreted, generated

double passive example:

the code is interpreted by Python and is compiled by C++

mix:

Pyton interprets the code, but code is compiled by C++

active:

Python interprets the code, but C++ compiles the code.
