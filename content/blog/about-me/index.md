I'm from McKinney, Texas. I studied Finance at Texas Tech University. I began programming at Texas Tech starting with Python to automate some stuff that I was learning in college. I then moved to web development taking courses on Udemy. After college I moved to St. Louis to join the family business, but knew I really wanted to do web development so I wen't to Lambda School to explore my passion writing code.

<br>

After Lambda School I got a job with Eastman Chemical as a Software Engineer working on the [Core](https://morewithcore.com/) product.

<br>

In my free time I like to learn new programming languages and work on projects. I was also really inspired by [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)'s reasoning for why you should learn computer science as a self-taught/bootcamp programmer, so I've been working on going through some of the recommended [courses](https://bpp.dev/articles/teachyourselfcs/programming/00-getting-started/).

<br>

Outside of programming I enjoy watching sports, especially Football and Hockey. I also like following investing and built a [project](https://gifted-tereshkova-7f35b7.netlify.app/) that runs a linear regression to calculate beta for the required rate of return. This calculation is then used to plot companies on the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier).
