#### LECTURES
##### L18

OOP is a implementation of lambda.
<br>
<br>

class
<br>
instance
<br>
instantiation variable 
<br>
clause
<br>
method
<br>
instance-vars
<br>
Class variables
<br>
<br>

Anytime you change the value of something use a exclamation point to signify you are not doing functional programming.


##### L19

OOP implements inheritance through delegation (assigning to something else).
<br>
<br>
Child looks for the methods and if it can't find it the message is sent to the parent.
<br>
<br>
default-method: what to do when the parent can't handle the message.
<br>
<br>
initialize: method only used once to setup the class
<br>
<br>
dispatch procedure: takes message and returns a method.
