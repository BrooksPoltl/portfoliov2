In the book atomic habits it says that a good way of setting habits is the make the goal very small and work from there. The simple goal is to log a couple metrics every day. If I can do that the day was a success.

<br>

That being said there are some things I want to do fitness wise as a plan of how I want to do things for various health benefits.
I'll start with cutting weight. Right now I'm at 230, I plan to cut down to 200 by walking and eating a ketogenic diet. After that I'll reimplement weight training using a simple push/pull/legs split still tbd whether or not I'll switch to a normal weight training diet at that time.
I'll cut to 170, before starting a bulk cycle.

<br>

metrics to gather:

- running/walking miles
- calories burned via apple watch
- weight
- notes (optional)

<br>

The only real goal is gathering this data daily, no obligation to hit these in any notable way.
