#### LECTURES
##### User Interface Lectures
These lectures are in week 3 of the Calendar, but lecture 5 and 6 for spring 2010 so I'll just list them here since order doesn't matter for them.
##### L05
This lecture goes over "User interface design" a lecture by Alan Kay. Alan Kay is the inventor of every aspect of the modern computer environment.
<br>
<br>

Dynabook was a computer that looks like a calculator.

##### L06
This lecture goes over part 2 of "User interface design". This specific lecture goes over the psychology of UI.
##### L07
###### Time Efficiency and Order of Growth

Measure efficiency by how many constant time expressions are used.
<br>
<br>

`se` runtime is dependent on how it is used.
<br>
<br>
Range: what does it return.
<br>
Calculate runtime for best and worst case scenarios.
<br>
<br>
Constant factors not very valuable in runtime because of Moore's law. Also as `n` grows constants become less significant.
<br>
<br>
Highest power of `n` is the one that counts.
