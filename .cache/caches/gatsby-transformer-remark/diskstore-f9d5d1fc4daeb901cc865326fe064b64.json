Most languages do simple operations the same way we learned in grade school (infix notation):\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">2 + 2 + 3</code><br>\nScheme uses a different syntax where the operator is always on the left (prefix notation) and you can add as many numbers as you would like:\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">(+ 2 2 3)</code><br>\nNow lets say we want to do something like:  <br><code class=\"language-text\">2 + 2 +  3 - 4</code><br>\nIn Scheme you can simply nest operators:\n<br><code class=\"language-text\">(- (+ 2 2 3) 4)</code><br>\n<br>\nWhen you first see this it looks way more complicated, but what is happening under the hood makes it a lot clearer. Scheme takes the arguments and then computes the functions of the arguments until it gets down to a primitive value.\n<code class=\"language-text\">(+ 2 2 3)</code> is a function and not a primitive value, so it calls <code class=\"language-text\">(+ 2 2 3)</code>. The left argument of the <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> is now 7 and it has 2 primitive values, meaning it can calculate the <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> to get 3.</p>\n<h6>Defining function</h6>\n<h6>L02</h6>\n<h5>BOOK</h5>\n<h6>1.1</h6>\n<h6>1.2</h6>\n<h6>1.3</h6>\n<h5>LABS</h5>\n<h6>Lab 1</h6>\n<h6>Lab 2</h6>"}
