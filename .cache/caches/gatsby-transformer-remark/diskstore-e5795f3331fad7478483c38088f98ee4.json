Pure functions are easily testable because they don’t require any dependencies and we can just throw things into the input and test the output with very low overhead. The low overhead makes it really easy to test for multiple edge cases and also makes the test faster and scalable.</p>\n<h4>Side Effects</h4>\n<p>Side effects are things that prevent a function from returning the same output, these are “dependencies” that the function needs to know for the output.\n<br>\nfor example:</p>\n<h3>Mutability</h3>\n<h3>First Class Functions</h3>\n<h3>Lambda</h3>\n<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>\n<h2>Opinions</h2>"}
