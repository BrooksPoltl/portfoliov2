This was 5 years before apple silicon.</p>\n<p>All computers we are building comprise of synchronous or digital systems.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Synchronous:\nAll operations coordinated by a central clock\n“heartbeat” of the system.</p>\n<p>Digital:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Represent all values by discrete values</li>\n<li>Two binary digits: 1 and 0</li>\n<li>Electrical signals are treated as 1’s and 0’s</li>\n<li>1 and 0 are complements of each other</li>\n<li>high / low voltage for true / false 1 / 0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>switches</h4>\n<p>if switch is closed light is on if switch is open light is off (simple circuits).</p>\n<p>if two switches is a line it creates an “and” because both must be on.</p>\n<p>if two switches are parallel it creates an “or” because it can choose either one.</p>\n<h3>L10</h3>\n<h3>L11</h3>\n<h2>HW</h2>\n<h3>HW 3</h3>\n<h3>Project 1</h3>\n<h2>READINGS</h2>"}
