Gives a set of sentences in logical form, to form rules to determine an output.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5>L43</h5>\n<p>Unification: Variables on both sides (bindings), you can use unification to compute anything computable (Turing complete). Popular in database systems.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5>L44</h5>\n<p>Programming Paradigms:\n<br>\nfunctional\n<br>\nobject oriented\n<br>\nclient/server\n<br>\ndeclarative/logic</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Most programs use multiple paradigms, but are smart in how they implement each (not using concurrency for object oriented task).\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>Some languages only functional or OOP, but better for it to be in your head that way you can write programs taking advantage of multiple paradigms.\n<br>\n<br>\nhigh level language: abstracts away the inner workings of the computer\n<br>\nlow level language: exposes parts of the inner workings so you can manipulate the machine.</p>\n<h4>READING</h4>\n<h5>4.1.7</h5>\n<p>Evaluator is inefficient, analyzes syntax multiple times in an expression, it can be made more efficient by creating a procedure that analyzes the syntax and returns a procedure that can be executed.</p>\n<h5>4.2</h5>\n<h5>4.3</h5>\n<h5>4.4</h5>"}
