Pure functions are easily testable because they don’t require any dependencies and we can just throw things into the input and test the output with very low overhead. The low overhead makes it really easy to test for multiple edge cases and also makes the test faster and scalable.</p>\n<h4>Side Effects</h4>\n<p>Side effects are things that prevent a function from returning the same output, these are “dependencies” that the function needs to know for the output.\n<br>\nfor example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  function square() {\n    const a = getNumberFromTheDatabase();\n    return a ** 2\n  }</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here we are calling square and the output is dependent on the number we get back from the database, if that number changes our output changes despite having the same input.\nIf we wanted to test the logic in this case (squaring) we would have to stub out the function call to the database.</p>\n<h3>Mutability</h3>\n<p>Mutability in programming is the ability to change the data.</p>\n<p>for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  let i = 0;\n  i = 1;</code></pre></div>\n<p>The second line reassigns the variable i. Reassignment should be avoided as much as possible because it makes the code a lot harder to read. When code has a lot of reassignment its hard for the programmer to tell what a variable is at a given point.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Example of how to avoid reassignment:</p>\n<h3>First Class Functions</h3>\n<h3>Lambda</h3>\n<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>\n<h2>Opinions</h2>"}
