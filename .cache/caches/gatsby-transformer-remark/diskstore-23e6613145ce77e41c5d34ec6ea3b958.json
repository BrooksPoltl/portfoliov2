C is close to underlying hardware.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>What is the cloud?\n<br>\nThe cloud is a data center of computers in a warehouse. They need to be near a river (to cool the computers) and low power cost. Also need to be in a secret location to avoid malicious attacks. Server can have 12 to 16 processors. Even single core can do many instructions at once. Tons of Logic Gates running in parallel.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Abstraction:\n<br></p>\n<p>hiding unnecessary details at the upper level.\n<br>\nMachine level, Assembly level, High level.\n<br>\n<br>\nMoore’s Law:\n<br>\nDesigning through trends.\n<br>\n“Amount of transistors on a chip will double every 2 years”\n<br>\nThis however is changing. They can make them smaller, but it is much more expensive to make them smaller.\n<br>\n<br>\nprinciple of locality (memory hierarchy):\n<br>\nSpeed on the computer dependent on locality.\nFastest memory is the registers. Chip Cache second closest, then Board Cache. Then Memory takes 10 times longer than cache. Disk are really slow (which is why they are gone now).</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Parallelism:\n<br>\nability to do multiple things at once. Parallelism is limited, performance gain is limited to how much has to be done sequentially.\n<br>\n<br>\nPerformance Measurement &#x26; improvement\n<br>\nFiguring how fast your code goes, and how to improve the performance.\n<br>\n<br>\nDependability via Redundancy\n<br>\nCoping with failures, You have to maintain backups for data stores that way you don’t lose data.\n<br>\n<br>\nbit terminology:\n<br>\n8-bit: byte\n<br>\n16-bit: half-words\n<br>\n32-bit: words\n<br>\n64-bit: double words\n<br>\n<br>\nInteger and floating-point operations can load to results too big within their representation (overflow/underflow).\n<br>\n<br>\nsigned and unsigned integers:</p>\n<h5>L2</h5>\n<h5>L3</h5>\n<h5>L4</h5>\n<h4>LABS</h4>\n<h5>LAB 0</h5>\n<h5>LAB 1</h5>\n<h4>HW 0</h4>\n<h4>READINGS</h4>\n<h5>2.4</h5>"}
