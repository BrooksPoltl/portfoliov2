Alan Kay is the inventor of every aspect of the modern computer environment.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>Dynabook was a computer that looks like a calculator.</p>\n<h5>L06</h5>\n<p>This lecture goes over part 2 of “User interface design”. This specific lecture goes over the psychology of UI.</p>\n<h5>L07</h5>\n<h6>Time Efficiency and Order of Growth</h6>\n<p>Measure efficiency by how many constant time expressions are used.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">se</code> runtime is dependent on how it is used.\n<br>\n<br>\nRange: what does it return.\n<br>\nCalculate runtime for best and worst case scenarios.\n<br>\n<br>\nConstant factors not very valuable in runtime because of Moore’s law. Also as <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> grows constants become less significant.\n<br>\n<br>\nHighest power of <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> is the one that counts.</p>\n<h5>L08</h5>\n<h6>Recursion and Iteration</h6>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">O(1) -------|\nO(log N)----| Searching\nO(N)--------|\n\nO(N log N)--|\nO(N**2) ----| Sorting\n\nO(2 ** N) --|\nO(N!)-------| intractable\nO(N**N)-----|</code></pre></div>\n<p>Theoretically impossible to do better than O(N log N) for sorting.\n<br>\nintractable: You can run them, but with large n they will never stop running.\n<br></p>\n<br>\n<br>\nO(N ** 3):\n<br>\n- matrix multiply\n<h5>L09</h5>\n<h5>L10</h5>\n<h5>L11</h5>\n<h5>L12</h5>\n<h5>L13</h5>\n<h4>LABS</h4>\n<h5>Lab 2A</h5>\n<h5>Lab 2B</h5>\n<h4>READINGS</h4>\n<h5>2.1</h5>\n<h5>2.2</h5>\n<h5>2.3</h5>"}
